										<h1>My Profile</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>I am Tupur Chandra. I live in Delhi-NCR. It's Vaishali, in Ghaziabad. My school is nearby, so my dad drops me to school everyday. They have school buses too. I want to go to school by bus, dad doesn't let me do it. He has told me that when I am in class 8, I can go to school cycilng. Till then, dad will drop me to school.</p>
									<p>I have already told you that I study in Indirapuram Public School, Indirapuram. Address is 6-II, Nyay Khand I, Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 201014.</p>

									<h2>Family</h2>
									<p>I live with may mom and dad. My dad is a journalist. He reads a lot, but I don't like much. He tells me a lot of bed time stories when I was kid. Now he seldom tells me one. He says I should creat stories on our own. I find It quite interesting. He helps me do my homework.</p>
									<p>My mom is a housewife. When I was a kind, she used to work as a web and graphic designer. She is a qualified teacher like my grand mother. She also has a journalism degree like my father. Now she does not go to work. I love her a lot. She cook tasty meals and desserts.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>School</h2>
									<p>The School began on April 16, 2003 as Bharatiya Vidya Bhavanâ€™s Public School in association with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Forging ahead Indirapuram Public School set course on its own on 1st April 2007. The School focuses on inculcating the best in its students by providing an environment in which the students discover and realize their potential.</p>
									<p>My school encourages a value system that is essentially Indian yet catering to the global perspective. Being a CBSE school, sharing online facilities that enable our school to be a pool school, where ideas are shared and welcomed.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Social Life</h2>
									<p>I love helping others which gets me many friends. In school, I have many friends, but no one is my favourite. I have some friends, with whom I play in the evening. I do cycling with them when I have time. I had made some friends in tutions classess too. But I don't go for private tutions now.</p>
									<p>I don't go out much, but I love traveling. I have gone to Hardwar, Vaishno Devi, Bangalore, Kodagu, Kolkata, Agra, Vaaishali. I love pets, and I have two parrots. I want to have a puppy, but my dad doesn't get me one. He says that I can have a puppy only when I promise to take care of her.</p>
